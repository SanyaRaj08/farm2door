**Farm2Door**
Farm2Door is a digital marketplace that connects farmers directly with consumers, eliminating middlemen to provide a platform for farmers to sell their products and for buyers to make direct purchases.
Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), it offers a seamless user experience, secure transactions, and a simple yet powerful interface for both sellers and buyers.

**Tech Stack**
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
API: RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend
Other Dependencies:

**Usage**
Sign up as a user or farmer to start using the platform.
Farmers can list their products by adding details like images, prices, and stock levels.
Buyers can browse products, add them to their cart, and make purchases directly from the farmers.
