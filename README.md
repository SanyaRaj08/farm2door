Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
API: RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend
Other Dependencies:

**Usage**
Sign up as a user or farmer to start using the platform.
Farmers can list their products by adding details like images, prices, and stock levels.
Buyers can browse products, add them to their cart, and make purchases directly from the farmers.
